## Overview & Features

This project automates the entire lifecycle of a GitLab Runner, from initial setup to registration and configuration. It is designed for reliability, consistency, and ease of use across multiple environments (development, staging, production).

-   âœ… **Strict & Explicit Configuration**: All settings are controlled via a single `.env` file. The system will fail with a clear error if any variable is missing, eliminating ambiguity.
-   âœ… **Zero-Touch Registration**: A robust shell script reads your `.env` file and executes a non-interactive registration command, ensuring a repeatable and error-free setup.
-   âœ… **Powerful Docker Executor**: Pre-configured to use the isolated and secure Docker executor, allowing your CI/CD jobs to run in clean, containerized environments.
-   âœ… **Persistent & Stateless**: The runner's configuration (`config.toml`) is stored in a Docker volume on the host, making the runner container itself stateless. It can be stopped, removed, or upgraded without losing its identity.
-   âœ… **Reusable & Environment-Agnostic**: Use the same repository and process to deploy runners on any server. Simply create a new `.env` file for each environment to ensure consistency.
-   âœ… **Comprehensive Logging**: The registration script provides clear, step-by-step output, making troubleshooting simple.

## How It Works

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns. You define *what* to deploy in the `.env` file, and the tools handle *how* to deploy it.

```

```

1.  You copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your specific details (GitLab URL, token, runner tags, etc.).
2.  `docker compose up -d` reads the `.env` file to start the GitLab Runner container service with the correct image and volume mounts.
3.  `./register-runner.sh` reads the same `.env` file and executes the `gitlab-runner register` command inside the running container, connecting it securely to your GitLab instance.
4.  The script finishes by restarting the container to ensure all settings are applied.

## Prerequisites

-   A server (VM or physical) with `sudo` or Docker group access.
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
-   A GitLab Runner **registration token**.
    -   In GitLab, navigate to your **Project** or **Admin Area**.
    -   Go to **Settings > CI/CD** and expand the **Runners** section.
    -   Click **New project runner** (or equivalent) and copy the token.

## Deployment in 4 Steps

Follow these steps on the server where you want the runner to operate.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacknitive/infra-gitlab-runner.git
cd infra-gitlab-runner
```

### Step 2: Create and Configure the `.env` File

This is the **only manual configuration step**. Copy the template and edit it with your values.

1.  **Create the `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file:**
    Open `.env` in a text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and provide a value for **every variable**. The scripts will not run without them. See the [Configuration Details](#configuration-details-env-variables) section below for a full explanation of each variable.

### Step 3: Launch the Runner Service

This command starts the GitLab Runner container in the background. It will be running but not yet registered with your GitLab instance.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

*This command will fail if required variables like `RUNNER_IMAGE_NAME` or `CONTAINER_NAME` are not set in your `.env` file.*

### Step 4: Register and Configure the Runner

This script automates the final setup.

1.  **Make the script executable (only needs to be done once):**
    ```bash
    chmod +x register-runner.sh
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./register-runner.sh
    ```

The script will register the runner, set the global concurrent job limit, and restart the container. Upon completion, you will see a `ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS!` message.

Your runner is now fully configured and operational! It is best practice to quickly verify its settings in the GitLab UI to ensure they match your `.env` file.

## Configuration Details (`.env` Variables)

All configuration is handled by these environment variables. **All variables are required.**

| `RUNNER_CONCURRENT_JOBS`        | The total number of jobs this runner instance can execute simultaneously. A good starting point is the number of CPU cores on the host. | `4`                                                        |

## Verification

You can confirm the runner is working correctly in two ways:

1.  **On the Server:** Check that the Docker container is running.
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see your container (e.g., `gitlab-runner-prod`) in the list with status `Up`.

2.  **In GitLab:** Navigate to the **Settings > CI/CD > Runners** page. The new runner should appear with a green circle, indicating it has connected successfully. Click the "Edit" icon to verify that the tags and other settings match what you defined in your `.env` file.

## Best Practices Implemented

-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The entire runner setup is defined in version-controlled files, making it traceable and reproducible.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Sensitive and environment-specific configuration (`.env`) is strictly separated from the deployment logic (`docker-compose.yml`, `register-runner.sh`).
-   **Explicit Declaration**: The system forces all configuration to be explicitly declared, avoiding ambiguity and "magic" default values that can cause confusion.
-   **Idempotency**: You can run `docker compose up -d` multiple times without negative side effects. The registration script is designed to be run once per new runner.
